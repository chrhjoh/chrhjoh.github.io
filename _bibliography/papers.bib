  abstract = {Abstract Aims Heterogeneity in the rate of β-cell loss in newly
              diagnosed type 1 diabetes patients is poorly understood and creates
              a barrier to designing and interpreting disease-modifying clinical
              trials. Integrative analyses of baseline multi-omics data obtained
              after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes may provide mechanistic
              insight into the diverse rates of disease progression after type 1
              diabetes diagnosis. Methods We collected samples in a pan-European
              consortium that enabled the concerted analysis of five different
              omics modalities in data from 97 newly diagnosed patients. In this
              study, we used Multi-Omics Factor Analysis to identify molecular
              signatures correlating with post-diagnosis decline in β-cell mass
              measured as fasting C-peptide. Results Two molecular signatures
              were significantly correlated with fasting C-peptide levels. One
              signature showed a correlation to neutrophil degranulation,
              cytokine signalling, lymphoid and non-lymphoid cell interactions
              and G-protein coupled receptor signalling events that were
              inversely associated with a rapid decline in β-cell function. The
              second signature was related to translation and viral infection was
              inversely associated with change in β-cell function. In addition,
              the immunomics data revealed a Natural Killer cell signature
              associated with rapid β-cell decline. Conclusions Features that
              differ between individuals with slow and rapid decline in β-cell
              mass could be valuable in staging and prediction of the rate of
              disease progression and thus enable smarter (shorter and smaller)
              trial designs for disease modifying therapies as well as offering
              biomarkers of therapeutic effect.},

  abstract = {Background: Once considered a disease observed in older adults,
              type 2 diabetes is now increasingly seen in youth and adolescence.
              Young-onset patients often experience diagnostic delays and have an
              increased risk of complications compared to individuals with a
              later onset. Timely intervention has already shown to lower the
              risk of complications emphasising the need for new detection
              methods in the young-onset type 2 diabetes domain. Methods: We
              constructed a deep learning-based prediction algorithm of
              young-onset type 2 driven by routine care data from both primary
              and secondary healthcare sectors. We predicted future risk of
              diabetes for multiple time horizons spanning 0-24 months using
              prior hospital diagnoses, primary care prescriptions, and primary
              care health service events from nation-wide Danish health
              registries. The algorithm was trained on patient health
              trajectories from 3,435,638 individuals of whom 16,828 individuals
              experienced young-onset type 2 diabetes in the period 1995-2018.
              Findings: Using both primary and secondary care registries showed
              an increased performance over models trained on data from single
              registries. Relative risks of the 0·1% highest-risk individuals
              compared to the general population ranged from 118·1 when
              predicting debut within 3-15 months from the date of assessment to
              74·6 for 12-24 months in the integrated model and 97·2 to 51·9 for
              the best single registry models. Cross-replication in each of the
              five Danish regions showed comparable performances with relative
              risks ranging from 130·3 to 104·8 when predicting debut within 3-15
              months and 58·7 to 46·3 for 12-24 months. Model explainability
              revealed emphasis on both well-established risk factors and on
              other factors previously linked mainly to late-onset type 2
              diabetes, with cardiovascular prescriptions increasing in
              importance close to diabetes debut. Interpretation: This study
              highlights the potential for using deep learning methods on
              longitudinal health data from both primary and secondary care to
              develop low-cost predictive tools, e.g. for screening for
              young-onset type 2 diabetes. },
