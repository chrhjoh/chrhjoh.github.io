  abstract = {Abstract Aims Heterogeneity in the rate of β-cell loss in newly
              diagnosed type 1 diabetes patients is poorly understood and creates
              a barrier to designing and interpreting disease-modifying clinical
              trials. Integrative analyses of baseline multi-omics data obtained
              after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes may provide mechanistic
              insight into the diverse rates of disease progression after type 1
              diabetes diagnosis. Methods We collected samples in a pan-European
              consortium that enabled the concerted analysis of five different
              omics modalities in data from 97 newly diagnosed patients. In this
              study, we used Multi-Omics Factor Analysis to identify molecular
              signatures correlating with post-diagnosis decline in β-cell mass
              measured as fasting C-peptide. Results Two molecular signatures
              were significantly correlated with fasting C-peptide levels. One
              signature showed a correlation to neutrophil degranulation,
              cytokine signalling, lymphoid and non-lymphoid cell interactions
              and G-protein coupled receptor signalling events that were
              inversely associated with a rapid decline in β-cell function. The
              second signature was related to translation and viral infection was
              inversely associated with change in β-cell function. In addition,
              the immunomics data revealed a Natural Killer cell signature
              associated with rapid β-cell decline. Conclusions Features that
              differ between individuals with slow and rapid decline in β-cell
              mass could be valuable in staging and prediction of the rate of
              disease progression and thus enable smarter (shorter and smaller)
              trial designs for disease modifying therapies as well as offering
              biomarkers of therapeutic effect.},
