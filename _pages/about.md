Working at the intersection of `health data science and machine learning`, I focus on understanding and predicting the progression of complex diseases. My research combines deep learning with electronic health records to `enable earlier disease detection and improved patient stratification`. I’m particularly interested in deep integrative analysis of `omics` and `health registry data`, and in how these `heterogeneous and sparse data` types can be effectively represented and combined for computational analysis. During my PhD, I’ve been involved in both predictive and descriptive projects within diabetes research — developing models to stratify progression types in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes patients, as well as building `predictive models` for underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed patient groups, such as those with young-onset type 2 diabetes or adult-onset type 1 diabetes.

My academic background is in biochemistry and bioinformatics, with a bachelor’s degree from the University of Copenhagen and a master’s degree from the Technical University of Denmark. I started out in structural biology, initially from a wet-lab perspective, before shifting toward bioinformatics and data science. My thesis in computational prediction of immunogenic peptides , sparked a broader interest in deep-learning and data-driven approaches to biomedical science. This foundation continues to shape how I think about `biological complexity`, `data integration`, and `translational applications in healthcare`.
