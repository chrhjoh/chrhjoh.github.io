Advent of Code is an annual coding challenge that blends problem-solving with holiday spirit. AoCSuite helps with some of the smaller tasks‚Äîright from the comfort of your terminal‚Äîso you can focus on the actual programming.

<div style="float: right; width: 300px; margin-left: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; text-align: center;">
    {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/aoc_calendar.png" title="Advent of Code Calendar view" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    <div class="caption" style="font-size: 0.9rem;">Advent of Code Calendar View</div>
</div>

The tool fetches the puzzle and your input, and generates a solution template in your favorite language (as long as it's Python or Rust‚Ä¶). It also supports running, benchmarking, and submitting your solution to Advent of Code once you've got the correct result.

Please be mindful of Advent of Code's rate limits: you can only submit once per minute, and inputs are cached locally to minimize server load. AoCSuite is designed for convenience ‚Äî not for automation or abuse.

I originally built AoCSuite as a way to explore some extra concepts in Rust alongside solving the daily puzzles ‚Äî and a good way to practice by creating tiny tools and sharpen my systems thinking at the same time. If you find it useful, feel free to star the repo or use it as inspiration for your own Advent of Code setup.
